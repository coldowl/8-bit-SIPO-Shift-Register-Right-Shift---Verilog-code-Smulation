# 8-bit-SIPO-Shift-Register-Right-Shift---Verilog-code-Smulation
This project uses verilog to model and deisgn a SIPO right shift 8-bit shift register. It uses the exact sturcture and blocks that is used in the very popular 74HC595 IC. There are in total 8 D-flipflops, out of which four gets used as lathes and four to shift the data. All the input and outputs are named exactly same as the IC - DS, SPHS
